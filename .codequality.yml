# Code Quality Configuration for KwikOFF
# This file defines best practice standards for the codebase

standards:
  # File length limits
  files:
    max_length: 1000          # Hard limit - build will fail
    warn_length: 500          # Warning threshold
    exclude_patterns:
      - "*/Migrations/*"      # Auto-generated migrations
      - "*/bin/*"
      - "*/obj/*"
      - "*/wwwroot/lib/*"     # Third-party libraries
  
  # Class/Component length limits
  classes:
    max_length: 500           # Hard limit
    warn_length: 300          # Warning threshold
  
  # Method length limits
  methods:
    max_length: 100           # Hard limit
    warn_length: 50           # Warning threshold
  
  # Complexity limits (cyclomatic complexity)
  complexity:
    max_complexity: 15        # Hard limit
    warn_complexity: 10       # Warning threshold

enforcement:
  # When to run checks
  on_push: true               # Run on git push
  on_pull_request: true       # Run on PR creation/update
  weekly_audit: true          # Run weekly scheduled check
  
  # Actions on failure
  block_push: true            # Prevent push if checks fail
  create_issue: true          # Create GitHub issue on scheduled check failure
  notify_slack: false         # Set to true and configure webhook if needed

rationale:
  file_length: |
    Files should be under 1000 lines to maintain readability and testability.
    Best practice is under 500 lines. Consider:
    - Single Responsibility Principle
    - Extracting helper classes
    - Using partial classes for large auto-generated code
  
  class_length: |
    Classes should be under 500 lines and ideally under 300 lines.
    Large classes often indicate multiple responsibilities.
    
  method_length: |
    Methods should be under 100 lines and ideally under 50 lines.
    Long methods are harder to test and understand.
    Extract smaller, focused methods.
